# Data Description and sources

 All data concerning closed project of Interreg programs. Sources : [BD KEEP](https://www.keep.eu/). MetaData available in the [FAQ](https://www.keep.eu/faqs#) in "Data. What kind of data is available in Keep? ".
 
 
"LeadPartners file" contains all information about each project and its Lead Partner.
"Partner File" contains all the different partners (Lead Partner or not) and the name of the project in which it was involved. 

There may be several involments for a single partner entity.


# Main Goals

- To perform a locational analysis of the density of participation to Interreg programs.

- To aggregate the different partner entity into the urban areas to which they belong.

- To differentiate Lead Partner (that initiate the project) and its Partners.

- To look for hierarchical structure : urban concentration, differenciation between countries, regions and cities. To test rank-size hypotheses.


# Main steps needed

- (1) Geocode all partners 
- (2) Aggregate data : make a list of unique partners
- (3) Correct error in geocoding
- (4) First analysis of density (grid) with all Partners and lead Partners (and first with all involments)
- (5) Spatial Joint with Urban Areas (UMZ database)
- (6) Find a solution for entity outside urban areas (get an administrative population for example, or just filter the sample)
- (7) Map aggregate participation at the urban areas level. and performe rank-size analysis (with participations and number of partners in Urban areas)
- (8) Recognise Urban Governement and cities in the list of partner
- (9) Filter the dataset to keep only projects that involved a majority of cities.
- (10) Perform locational analysis on the filtered dataset

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
