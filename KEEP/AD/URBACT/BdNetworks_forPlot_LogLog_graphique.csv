The European Commission<U+FFFD>s Smart Cites and Communities Strategic Implementation Plan (2013) includes a requirement for cities to develop innovative approaches to finance as a key enabler. Levels of investment mean that cities cannot rely upon public sector funding alone and need to develop new market-oriented and sustainable strategies for public-private cooperation generating external investment. The ability to access this is linked to the ability to overcome or mitigate risks associated with deployment of the technologies.

For the past two decades, urban development and planning practice in European cities and regions have focussed on the renewal of metropolitan cores and historic inner cities. This has resulted in numerous success stories, but the wave of urban renewal in inner cities has generally coincided with strong population growth and demographic changes. Many inner cities have reached their peak in terms of density, population and mobility. At the same time most of the housing in 20th century (sub)urban areas are in need of renovation. The next logical step is a combined solution to these issues by reconverting the 20th century neighbourhoods, to create a more sustainable and attractive environment.;"Sub>urban network focuses on solving the challenge in a very particular context of:
- increasing population densities within city borders instead expanding urban territory
- uncovering new planning practices, processes, instruments and partnerships to achieve the best possible local outcome
- regional coordination between historic inner cities, suburbs and greater metropolitan areas
- parallel development of an experimental setting as well as an action plan for tangible areas

- Tourism as a way of facilitating local economic and cultural development;
- Encouraging small enterprise and innovation;
- Physical improvements to important buildings and open spaces;
- Strategic partnership and planning to regenerate housing markets, re-use land and buildings and manage town centres; and
- Community development to build confidence, tackle prejudice and engage both young and older people in meaningful activity and dialogue.";"The main output of the SURE network will be the integrated Socio-economic Urban Rehabilitation model, which is based on the experience of SURE partners and best practices and designed to provide guidance for other practitioners who intend to develop similar strategies for their own towns and cities. This will be complemented by a toolkit on participatory approaches towards planning and strategy development in deprived neighborhoods. The SURE model will be disseminated in national languages in the frame of publication of booklets. It will be prepared with the help of the Lead Expert for the final conference, together with policy recommendations and a best practice collection.
In line with the URBACT II principles, each partner has to make a Local Action Plan (LAP), which must be based on the lesson learnt during the exchange and learning activities of the project, and Local Support Groups (LSG) has a central role in the design and implementation of the LAPs. The heart of the SURE network are the LSGs which have set up by each city partner. The overall aim of the LSGs is to improve the impact of URBACT exchange activities at local level. LSG helps to spread the learning from transnational exchanges to a broader cross-section of local stakeholders and to ensure that the lessons learnt lead to change at a local level. The animation of LSGs will be organised through at least 10 local workshops per city partner.
Within this broad framework SURE partners will focus on the exploration of the above five specific topics which reflect their particular local circumstances and which will have to be addressed in conjunction with each other. These include:(any) sustainable socio-economic regeneration for all partner cities. SURE partners are supported in their work through a continuous supply of information on practical examples which reflect internationally recognised good practice and study visits designed to explore particular problems in greater depth and to exchange experience with other URBACT networks that share similar interest.

To face this phenomenon, the solutions that are needed cannot be only based on economic resources but should also take into account the citizens themselves for job creation through social links, the pooling of efforts and the seeking for innovative solutions based on local needs. So to say, the search for solutions to the crisis should be better shared between public authorities, economic stakeholders, etc...
Considering this, a certain number of European cities have developed in the past years, impelled by the Council of Europe, the idea of promoting the co-responsibility of actors (public authorities, companies, associations, citizens, etc.) to provide the well-being of all and to avoid situations of exclusion. They use for this a methodology of building indicators of well-being with the citizens themselves, the methodology SPIRAL (https://spiral.cws.coe.int). This methodology enables to define ways of progress towards the well-being of all, to identify the situations of exclusion not only based on material criteria, but also immaterial ones. The goal is to enlarge the impact of public and private actions considering these criteria and to develop pilot actions of social inclusion around the idea of co-responsibility of the actors themselves. The coordination of these activities is provided by a steering committee regrouping the representatives of all local stakeholders (municipality, public services, companies, associations, citizens, etc.).
";"This approach has allowed to launch innovative pilot actions of social inclusion for overextended people, long-term unemployed people, basic guaranteed income beneficiaries, children and young people of disadvantaged neighborhoods or districts, children failing at school (approach applied in high schools) and on specific themes such as access to housing.
It has also allowed to enlarge the concept of social inclusion over the economic exclusion to take into account the ill-being in its different dimensions, such as ill-being at work (using the approach in companies), at school or in the neighborhood<U+FFFD>s life.

Active living positively contributes to social cohesion, wellbeing and economic prosperity in cities. However, currently cities are challenged by the opposite: dramatic increase in the frequency of diseases as a result of sedentary life style and social exclusion.
To tackle these challenges, European cities have invested in large scale sports facilities over the past decades.

For the first time the European Commission dedicated 50 B<U+FFFD> to the development of European cities for 2014-2020. The European Commission developed tools such as the Integrated Territorial Investment or the Urban Axis in order to get the results and objectives closer to the needs of the cities and further than national level. The CIA 7 network consists in understanding the role of the cities in this 2014-2020 European programming and the way they use the tools to their development. One city is one way to implement Article 7 but we are all facing the same challenges and we all have the same goal to implement the integrated strategy at the local level. How to achieve this aim during a fixed programming period? What do we want to develop? How to include all stakeholders to build the project? To answer these questions, the network will develop exchanges between partners into topics such as the development of integrated approach, the involvement of local stakeholders, the evaluation and the gap between strategy and implementing. The network would like to develop recommendations to cities implementing Article 7 and to be part of the discussions for the next programming period.;;Cities;Europe;Western Europe;8;313894,125;286606,5;248988,6333;61995339511;1004672,25;586074;1,72635E+12;1313905,382;FR16;Lille;341722;231491;Lille // Roubaix // Tourcoing;349029;1388300;341722;325666;349029;949868,2857;Urbact III;Large City;2.Large City;7

The joint policy challenge for the network is to better facilitate the above <U+FFFD>creative ecosystem<U+FFFD> to be able to attract (more) creative entrepreneurs and boost creative entrepreneurship in dedicated urban areas. Creative industries comprise economic activities that create economic value through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property. A city is able to mobilise ideas, talents and creative organizations when it knows how to foster a creative milieu by identifying, nurturing, attracting and sustaining talent. Local governments all over the world are increasingly becoming aware of the CCI<U+FFFD>s potential to generate jobs, wealth, and cultural engagement. With their diverse industries, variety of urban forms and as magnets of skilled workforce, and cultural diversity, cities and their emerging creative milieus (city centres, re-designed factories and brownfield areas, etc.) can be a supportive environment for the actors of the creative economy, ranging from arts and cultural institutions to vibrant start-up scenes. This is especially important since dynamic, youthful companies tend to value a vibrant, open-minded community life and the availability of services (shopping, cafes, and entertainment) as key location factors. The nine partner cities in the CREATIVE SPIRITS network already have, to different extents, strategies to boost the creative ecosystems in their cities. The central focus of the network is on how to implement these strategies. The partnership enables the partner cities to exchange knowledge and learn from each other to overcome the implementation challenges related to their creative urban strategies.;;Cities;Europe;Eastern Europe;9;271553;139049;375373,6081;1,40905E+11;554880,7778;332828;4,33461E+11;658377,7788;HU14;Újbuda;135618;139049;Budapest;330766;2057700;135618;288116;330766;367028,375;Urbact III;Large City;1.Very Large City;8

JobTown 2 is a transnational knowledge-sharing Implementation Network, comprising seven city municipal authorities.
We work together - with local stakeholders - to develop innovative, practical approaches to tackling youth unemployment under the ERDF URBACT III Programme.
Youth unemployment is a major challenge for all our communities; without effective action, the failure of young people to enter the labour market has significant financial, social and personal costs.
These costs include loss of taxation and increased public costs in welfare benefits; the loss of talent and potential workers from the labour force, reducing the pool of available labour and affecting businesses<U+FFFD> ability to grow; individuals loss of identity, ambition and a stake in society, increasing alienation and, potentially, anti-social behaviour; young people losing their ability to earn, learn and have a positive, independent future for themselves and their families.
While the effects of unemployed young people are well known, the causes are different from place to place and from individual to individual; finding solutions that are affordable, that work, and have a lasting impact are proving very difficult to find.
By working together and sharing know-how, the JobTown 2 partners will develop new thinking, approaches and activities to tackle youth unemployment and share this knowledge widely within the URBACT community and globally.
Each Network partner will work with their local employers (private, public & third sectors), groups and communities, schools and colleges, to try to find new, practical, local approaches to tackle youth unemployment and to give young people better, brighter futures.
The results will be shared through Network meetings, events, conferences, publications, websites and ongoing contacts.

This represents a serious challenge, as ESL has significant societal and individual consequences, such as a higher risk of unemployment, poverty, marginalization and social exclusion. Tackling ESL means breaking the cycle of deprivation and the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality.
ESL is a specific problem, but engages a very complex field of play to solve it. It calls for a shift from implementing isolated ESL measures to introducing integrated, comprehensive policies, based on strong and continuous political commitment of all stakeholders at all levels.
The role of local authorities in developing and implementing ESL policies is crucial: they can translate European and national strategies into specific actions tailored to the local needs and coordinate cross sectoral implementation at the right level.
Stay TunED aims to reduce the high urban rates of Early School Leaving (ESL) by actively pursuing the implementation of the 2011 Council Recommendation on policies to reduce ESL. The network will capitalise on existing urban expertise and strive for improved implementation with sustainable impact. This requires changes in organisations and the mind-set of people: a systematic configuration of services, eroded boundaries between services and professions, development of synergies, clear definition of roles and responsibilities.";"The network will realise this by focusing on the common challenges faced by implementing each local action plan against ESL:
Ensuring the integrated approach in the delivery of the strategy and its related actions/projects,
Maintaining involvement of local stakeholders and organising decision-making for delivery,
 Setting up efficient indicators and monitoring systems to measure performance,
 Moving from strategy to operational action plan.";Cities;Europe;Western Europe;9;870155,5556;413782;1081056,776;1,16868E+12;1679233,333;772876;2,76883E+12;1663981,203;BE5;Ghent;477284;253914;Brussels;691342;4376050;477284;947185,75;691342;1342131,25;Urbact III;Large City;1.Very Large City;10

Socioeconomic disparities and other forms of inequalities are a major issue in European cities and hinder citizens from achieving a decent quality of life. The economic and financial crisis has further intensified the concentration of poverty and social exclusion in cities. European cities are threatened by the increase of social polarisation, which is a consequence of many parallel processes: among which a rising volatily of employment and a recent boom in migrations to Europe and its cities. These factors are complemented by a progressively retreating welfare state and the privatisation of services in several countries leading to higher costs for basic needs. It has been observed that poverty does not only create social differences between people and groups; it also leads to spatial differences. Recent independent studies have demonstrated that this can be disastrous for the social stability and competitive power of cities.
URBinclusion is focused on the co-creation of new implementation solutions to reduce poverty in deprived urban areas. Integrated strategies addressing social inclusion will be implemented by the nine partners cities composing the network. Two optional implementation challenges were chosen: towards a new model of delivering public policies in the field of social inclusion and moving from a strategy to operational action-plan. The project will boost innovative methods of exchange and collective learning.The common policy challenge addressed by URBinclusion is founded on an \\""area-based approach\\"", concentrated on specific (deprived) geographic areas, with essentially place-based policies. This area-based approach is in some cases articulated, both with a sectorial approach regarding different dimensions related with poverty like employability, education, health care, housing, citizens' empowerment, social economy, and with a demographic approach, regarding different social groups like ethnic minorities, migrants, women, youth, older people, long term unemployed, Roma people, etc.
