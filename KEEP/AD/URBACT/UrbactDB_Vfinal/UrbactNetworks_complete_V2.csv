These sites often have a negative impact on their surroundings. On the other hand they present a great opportunity: the voids can be used to complete a compact settlement structure, to provide space for needed functions in the city.
Large buildings and building complexes that have lost their original purpose, are in decay and derelict, are the biggest opportunity within voids to support a sustainable city and neighborhood development. Because of their size they can provide space for a variety of needed social, economic and ecological as well as cultural functions. Often they are landmarks or identity anchor points.
But these larger buildings and building complexes are often too big to be redeveloped at one time and (financially) too big for just one investor. This results in a further decay of the building, up to the extent that they are a security hazard and an eyesore for the city. The challenge is to re-activate those \\""sleeping giants\\"" for the benefit of a sustainable urban (neighbourhood) development. It is about to bring these larger buildings and building complexes in use again, to rehabilitate them, providing space for what is needed in the neighborhood / in the city, to support an appropriation through indefinite users, to support a strategic uses of these premises, not only oriented on private exploitation interests, but also on interests of the common goods.";"Cooperatives, builders' groups, associations or foundations invest capital not for the purpose of short-term profit expectations.

More than half of the world’s population now lives in cities, and this figure is set to rise. This presents huge challenges for city leaders and managers needing to greatly expand municipal infrastructures including energy (heat and power), waste and water management as well as transportation.  The European Commission’s Smart Cites and Communities Strategic Implementation Plan (2013) includes a requirement for cities to develop innovative approaches to finance as a key enabler. Levels of investment mean that cities cannot rely upon public sector funding alone and need to develop new market-oriented and sustainable strategies for public-private cooperation generating external investment. The ability to access this is linked to the ability to overcome or mitigate risks associated with deployment of the technologies. By identifying these, the public sector can begin to unblock some of the barriers that limit private sector finance.
The key risks associated with the deployment of smart city technologies and solutions at a district level can be summarised as:
- Technology : the new technology does not perform as expected in real life deployment.
- Construction : unexpected complications or delays affecting the return on investment.
- Operational : suboptimal operation of the infrastructure or technology.
- Market : the market demands for the new infrastructure or technology are lower than expected.
- Policy : the regulatory framework changes leading to a fall in profit margins.
- Capability : the public authority labour force is not equipped with the skills to develop commercially based solutions for deployment in the market.

This represents a serious challenge, as ESL has significant societal and individual consequences, such as a higher risk of unemployment, poverty, marginalization and social exclusion. Tackling ESL means breaking the cycle of deprivation and the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality.
ESL is a specific problem, but engages a very complex field of play to solve it. It calls for a shift from implementing isolated ESL measures to introducing integrated, comprehensive policies, based on strong and continuous political commitment of all stakeholders at all levels.
The role of local authorities in developing and implementing ESL policies is crucial: they can translate European and national strategies into specific actions tailored to the local needs and coordinate cross sectoral implementation at the right level.

For the past two decades, urban development and planning practice in European cities and regions have focussed on the renewal of metropolitan cores and historic inner cities. This has resulted in numerous success stories, but the wave of urban renewal in inner cities has generally coincided with strong population growth and demographic changes. Many inner cities have reached their peak in terms of density, population and mobility. At the same time most of the housing in 20th century (sub)urban areas are in need of renovation. The next logical step is a combined solution to these issues by reconverting the 20th century neighbourhoods, to create a more sustainable and attractive environment.;"Sub>urban network focuses on solving the challenge in a very particular context of:

Active living positively contributes to social cohesion, wellbeing and economic prosperity in cities. However, currently cities are challenged by the opposite: dramatic increase in the frequency of diseases as a result of sedentary life style and social exclusion.
To tackle these challenges, European cities have invested in large scale sports facilities over the past decades. These strategies have a limited success, hence a new approach is needed: instead of""bringing' the inactive citizens to the sports facilities, public space itself should be turned into a low threshold facility inviting all citizens to physical activity. Street layout, land use, location of recreation facilities, parks and public buildings, the transport system can all encourage or discourage physical activity. Opportunities for physical activity need to be created close to where people live while also creating cleaner, safer, greener and more activity-friendly local environments.
In order to reach this, cities need to be equipped with new innovative tools to be used in urban design and planning (to redesign public spaces linked to sport activities, urban sports, games, physical exercises) to adequately provide for recreation and sport services and exploit potential social, health and economic benefits.
Efforts to enable and encourage sports require the participation and cooperation of many stakeholders, including local residents themselves and the creation of synergies among municipal departments or institutions. Moreover, municipalities need to be equipped with a new set of tools to be used in urban design and planning to adequately provide for recreation and sport services and exploit the potential social, health and economic benefits.";;Cities;Europe;Southern Europe;10;PT14;Loulé;Urbact III;Action Planning

The challenge set out by the Leipzig Charter may seem vast; nevertheless, it is only through joint efforts that we can truly aspire to better new housing developments  good, green, safe, and affordable which will eventually give birth to the cities we want for the future of our continent.
Project Hopus aims at promoting and implementing the use of design coding and other forms of \\""smart\\"" project guidance for the development of sustainable housing stock in European cities.
Design codes, widely adopted in practice, are basic manuals setting guidelines and standards ranging from urban design to building construction, and are addressed to both technical operators and local administrations. If correctly used, they can guarantee a high level of integration of sustainability strategies, with particular reference to developments carried out by private investors.
Through the help of the local support groups, the working group aims at experimenting the use of Design codes in all process phases, from the drafting to their final application in real urban situations. ";Cities;Europe;Southern Europe;5;IT36;Rome;Urbact II;Action Planning

So to say, the search for solutions to the crisis should be better shared between public authorities, economic stakeholders, etc...
Considering this, a certain number of European cities have developed in the past years, impelled by the Council of Europe, the idea of promoting the co-responsibility of actors (public authorities, companies, associations, citizens, etc.) to provide the well-being of all and to avoid situations of exclusion. They use for this a methodology of building indicators of well-being with the citizens themselves, the methodology SPIRAL (https://spiral.cws.coe.int). This methodology enables to define ways of progress towards the well-being of all, to identify the situations of exclusion not only based on material criteria, but also immaterial ones. The goal is to enlarge the impact of public and private actions considering these criteria and to develop pilot actions of social inclusion around the idea of co-responsibility of the actors themselves. The coordination of these activities is provided by a steering committee regrouping the representatives of all local stakeholders (municipality, public services, companies, associations, citizens, etc.).";"This approach has allowed to launch innovative pilot actions of social inclusion for overextended people, long-term unemployed people, basic guaranteed income beneficiaries, children and young people of disadvantaged neighborhoods or districts, children failing at school (approach applied in high schools) and on specific themes such as access to housing.
It has also allowed to enlarge the concept of social inclusion over the economic exclusion to take into account the ill-being in its different dimensions, such as ill-being at work (using the approach in companies), at school or in the neighborhood’s life.

>To promote a joint reflection on issues of population
mobility
>To provide recommendations to improve strategic planning

It was noted that ’mobility’ can be considered in both a positive and negative sense. For those mobile persons who have a choice to move due to a life change it is positive but for those persons in vulnerable situations such as asylum seekers they are often moved with no choice. The aim of the study was to focus on these vulnerable groups.
The study started by defining “what is a sustainable community?”. The following points were considered to help define this concept all of which are linked to quality of life:
>Active, Inclusive and Safe
>Fair for Everyone
>Well Served
>Well run
>Environmentally sensitive
>Well designed and built
>Well connected
>Thriving
The methodology for undertaking the study was to analyse statistical data, to carry out surveys and to focus on groups of key stakeholders such as community organisations. There was a different approach in each partner area, the scale of the analysis varied for example in Berlin the focus was on two deprived neighbourhoods. The availability of data at the same level varied and the perspective also varied, in Berlin the focus was on residents whereas in London and Brussels the focus was more on the service provider.";;Cities;Europe;Northern Europe;4;UK17;London;Urbact I;Urbact1

on an active dialogue between inhabitants, municipality
personnel, businesses, and elected representatives prior

with regard to the different examples present in their own
territories. This notion of ’city-regions’, which is extremely

boundaries of an urban nucleus and sometimes even
a country’s borders.

working, e.g. the economic benefits that have occurred and
how the greater scale of governance has affected economic
initiatives
3. To consider how city-regions have reduced parochialism,
in particular exploring how these governance structures can
improve social cohesion within the city-region, resulting in
benefits for all inhabitants
4. To explore how a successful city-region partnership can be
formed and understand how the city-region might be most
effectively resourced in terms of staff and finance

Institutional cooperation and cooperation networks;Urban development / Governance, partnership;Partners4action;U119;Public Private Partnerships in urban regeneration;UK;;2000;2006;"As one of the first approved thematic networks,
Partners4Action has a very specific theme focussing
on Public Private Partnerships in urban regeneration.
The lead partner city, Liverpool, has significant experience
in this theme and wanted to share this and learn from other
cities experiences.
The P4A network firstly undertook a baseline study to assess
the immediate needs of the partners to then allow them
to further develop their understanding of PPP. This entailed
gathering comparative data from the partner cities on their
perceptions of PPP and their current usage of PPP in order
to adopt a common framework to be used for the duration
of the network. In addition to the baseline study a glossary
of terms was created to ensure that in the exchange and
discussions all the partners had the same understanding
of what was being debated. This defined key concepts such
as urban regeneration and PPP itself.
The main activity of the network focussed on the development
and analysis of PPP case studies, based on the practical
experiences of the partners in undertaking projects in
their cities. These ranged from individual buildings through
to large scale area based regeneration schemes and the use
of a template format allowed the partners to identify common
features, issues, and characteristics that would of interest
and value to other regeneration practioners.
The network produced a “practitioners guide” illustrating
results and case studies which will be useful to other
European cities considering Public Private partnerships.
A CDROM is included within the report which explains in more
detail the case studies and also outlines in full the baseline
study.";;Cities;Europe;Northern Europe;13;UK16;Liverpool;Urbact I;Urbact1
Institutional cooperation and cooperation networks;Urban development;PHYRE;U116;Physical Regeneration of Urban Areas;DE;;2000;2006;"The PHYRE network adopted a cooperation model to
establish a strong partnership from the outset.
According to the network the prerequisites for effective
cooperation are:
Trust – built from previous working together or having
a strong common interest
Commitment – willingness to put forward competent experts
on the selected subject
Credentials – diversity of experience, scale and approach
makes for an interesting exchange.
PHYRE built their partnership around these prerequisites and
noted the importance of the start up conference to allow
partners to get to know each other, provide an opportunity for
organisational issues to be resolved, create a platform for
formal and informal deliberation, get a common
understanding of the agenda and the expectations
and obligations of each partner. At this first meeting the
partners identified 3 thematic seminars as key moments
of cooperation. These seminars would be preceded
by a preparatory meeting and followed up in the following
meeting to present the results. This focus on improving
mechanisms for transnational co-operation has a clear added
value: Seminars are based on better defined theme, the
concrete benefits for the partners are visible and the partners
are motivated to contribute and actively participate.
The three seminars addressed the three sub themes:
1. Social and Mobility Policy within urban regeneration
2. Physical regeneration in housing areas; Cooperation and
negotiation with owners; Innovative procedures in brownfield
redevelopment

Urban development;;PRE-REGENERATION;U117;New ways in Urban Governance for Cities of the former Soviet block;HU;;2000;2006;"Like most cities that were once part of the former Soviet
bloc, Hungarian cities have experienced major traumas,
especially social traumas, since the collapse of the old
regime. The problems that began during that time have yet
to be solved, and cities have to contend simultaneously with
housing problems, rehabilitation of existing buildings, issues
of environmental quality, unemployment and the precarious
situation of many inhabitants. The cities know that they must
change their policies and acquire new working methods
and new skills that are more effective and more relevant,
if they are to meet these challenges and respond effectively.
They decided therefore to reflect together on these necessary
changes, and to find ways of learning from the experience of
cities in the “older” Member States of the European Union.
This is the background to the proposal submitted by the City
of Miskolc on behalf of five other Hungarian cities.
The project consists of a three-day training session designed
to improve the capabilities of practitioners in the cities. There
were 20 practitioners from the 6 cities present and the aim of
the event was to cover the following:
> Day 1: integrated urban development policies in Europe;
support from European structural funds
>Day 2: methodology of an urban development project
financed by European structural funds
>Day 3: looking deeper into the issues through discussions
based on exchanges of experience

integrated development in disadvantaged neighbourhoods
with a particular focus on integration of ethnic minorities.
The network, which started in January 2004 with 4 main
sub themes: physical urban renewal, integration of ethnic

One of the most innovative elements of the REGENERA
network was the Officer Exchange. Three individuals per city
had the opportunity to spend five days in one of the
REGENERA partner cities in order to deepen their knowledge
of how that city implements the integrated approach to urban
regeneration. This intense method of exchange proved to be
very successful.";;Cities;Europe;Western Europe;11;FR18;Lyon;Urbact I;Urbact1

on reinforcing the role cities play in shaping employment
policies. Since starting work in March 2004 this network has
held a total of 9 working meetings including international
conferences and expert meetings. These meetings have
covered topics such as the irregular economy, employment
policies for target groups like young people, older people,
long term unemployed and ethnic minorities and use of ICT
in employment policies.
The presence of a large number of Italian partners in this
network could be due to the fact that Italian Municipalities
encounter a lot of problems when dealing with employment
policies, not to mention the fact that the country’s parallel
economy and illegal work situation are far worse than
in any other Member State.
At the beginning of the REGENERANDO partnership,
the eleven city partners reviewed their city centre strategies
with regard to employment issues and this information was
developed into a matrix which was then used to identify
5 categories for action:
1. State of Action including financial resources and target
group
2. Actions directed against the irregular economy
3. Actions encouraging employment

The working group members were either experts,
practitioners or academics from the local, regional and
national levels with expertise in fields of urban and regional
policy making, urban knowledge exchange, architecture,
spatial planning, culture, economic and sustainable
development.
The group has held 5 working group meetings plus the
symposium event itself. The Working Group research for the
Symposium set out to stimulate debate at a number of levels:
>What are the skills needed to create and manage
successful places throughout Europe?
>What are the skills and training needs associated
specifically with good governance models and effective
partnership working?
>Is there evidence of a skills gap and what barriers exist to
overcoming any gaps?
>What strategies and actions are in place at national,
regional or local levels to promote skills development

Knowledge and technology transfer;Urban development;STRIKE;U125;Strategies for Urban Regions in the Knowledge Economy;NL;;2000;2006;"In debates about Europe’s position in the knowledge
economy, the role of cities is rarely mentioned. This is quite
surprising, as the knowledge economy is very much an urban
economy. Moreover, generalised discussions about the
knowledge economy – useful as they are – hide a very
differentiated picture: some urban regions do very well,
while others stay behind. This working group made an
attempt to fill this gap, and put the spotlight on the role of
cities and urban regions in the knowledge economy. Moreover,
the group focused on the interrelations between local,
regional, national and EU actions to promote the knowledge
economy on the urban level. It illustrated current practices
in various countries, and sought to raise discussions about
improving the governance of the knowledge economy.

competitiveness and innovation and the impact on the cities
needs and the transformation in potential. The name STRIKE

development of sea towns and focuses on an integrated
approach to urban development in these areas. The main aim
of the working group is to identify the key economic actions of the port areas (cruising, commercial activities) and to
analyse their impact on the territory in terms of physical,
economic, social, environmental and cultural transformations.
The working group set out to examine how good practices
carried out by private actors (associations, foundations,
cooperatives, enterprises) has led to the insertion of low
qualified people whilst complying with the restrictions
of public politics.
The working group focused on:
>The tools adopted by each town to protect and monitor the
development of these port areas
>The identification of competent actors in managing these
areas
>A selection of projects about the valorisation and
transformation of the harbour and their surrounding areas
and the effect on economic, social and environmental matters
At the first meeting of the working group the following sub
themes were identified:
Theme 1 – Physical Regeneration in Port Areas
>Physical characteristics – common points and differences
>Environmental Impact
>Infrastructure – transport system
>Urban regeneration in port areas – land use, change
of function for buildings
Theme 2 – Economic and Social Dimension
>Economic – port activities, tourism, industry, service
sector
>Social – potential actions, completed actions, weaknesses,
local specificities
>Culture – social integration, infrastructure
Theme 3 – Management Instruments
>Management Tools – legal situation, innovative solutions

2. promoting inclusion of communities in decision making
and benefit sharing from redevelopment
3. contributing to intercultural awareness and understanding
of values from local community level to national, transnational
and European level

urban regeneration cannot be done without considering the
cultural heritage of the city as a whole or that of one
of its districts, and a city’s cultural baggage should even be
the starting point for urban regeneration initiatives.";;Cities;Europe;Southern Europe;5;MT3;Valletta;Urbact I;Urbact1

Over a two-year period, the URBANITAS network united eight cities from as many different countries – with a substantial proportion coming from new Member States – around the subject of “urban breakdown”. From defining the very concept of “urban breakdown” to recommending possible solutions, the exchanges between the cities highlighted the multi-faceted nature of the notion of “urban breakdown”. In Krakow, for example, the river is responsible for the physical dislocation of the urban area, whilst in Albacete it is the ring road that isolates one part of the city. In Berlin-Mitte, meanwhile, a huge piece of wasteland surrounding a rail line in the heart of the city destroys the urban continuity. In order to achieve the objective of finding a common strategy to address urban breakdown, a series of seminars were organised on the following sub themes:
> Physical dislocations: roads, waterways and rail networks,
mono-functional areas like offices and business parks
> Social dislocations; behavioural, economic, identity-based
dislocations, social exclusion
